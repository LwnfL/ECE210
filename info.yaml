  title:       "Time-Multiplexed LIF"
  author:      "Sam Wang"
  discord:     ""
  description: "Time-multiplexed dual leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron circuit. Two 8-bit neurons share a single sequential update path, alternating on even/odd clock ticks. Each neuron leaks by 1, integrates an 8-bit unsigned input current, and fires (spike + state reset) when the membrane potential reaches 200."
  language:    "Verilog"
  clock_hz:    0

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module: "tt_um_lif"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.
